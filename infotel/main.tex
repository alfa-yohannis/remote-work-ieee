\begin{abstract}
	This paper presents a qualitative study conducted to identify key components for an IT framework to support the implementation of remote work in Indonesia. The study focuses on employees’ experiences and perceptions during the transition from traditional office-based environments to remote work settings, particularly in response to shifting work norms. It investigates four main aspects: the perceived advantages and disadvantages of remote work, the technological requirements, and the ethical considerations that arise in distributed work arrangements. Data were gathered through an online questionnaire distributed across various sectors, resulting in 97 valid responses. The responses were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis to uncover patterns and common themes. The analysis revealed that employees view flexibility, time efficiency, and reduced commuting expenses as major benefits of remote work. Conversely, communication difficulties, work-life imbalance, and technical constraints were noted as the most significant drawbacks. Furthermore, participants expressed specific expectations for supportive digital tools, robust infrastructure, and ethical standards concerning privacy and fairness. Drawing from these findings, the study identifies six candidate components essential for an IT framework aimed at facilitating effective and sustainable remote work practices. The anonymised dataset has been made publicly available to encourage further research and practical development in the Indonesian remote work context.

\section{Introduction}

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly transformed how employees and organisations conduct work. Many companies shifted from office-based to remote work arrangements to maintain business continuity and employee safety. This transition introduced both benefits and challenges, especially in regions where remote work culture and digital infrastructure were underdeveloped. In Indonesia, the shift highlighted various factors affecting employee productivity, communication, well-being, and ethical considerations.

Although several studies have examined remote work globally, limited research has focused on the Indonesian context, particularly from employees across different industries. Understanding perceived advantages, disadvantages, technological needs, and ethical aspects is essential for organisations aiming to improve remote work policies.

This study addresses this gap by collecting and analysing qualitative data on employees' perceptions of remote and office-based work in Indonesia. The data, gathered through an online survey, provides insights into work preferences, technology use, and ethical concerns. Based on the analysis, the study proposes an IT framework to support remote work implementation. The key contributions are: (1) providing a qualitative dataset on remote and office-based work perceptions in Indonesia; (2) identifying perceived benefits and challenges of different work arrangements; (3) capturing expectations regarding supporting technologies and ; and (4) proposing an IT framework for remote work practices.


\section{Related Work}

Recent studies have examined the transformation of work arrangements, particularly remote and hybrid models, following the COVID-19 pandemic. Yang et al.~\cite{yang2022effects} found that remote work increased flexibility but reduced synchronous communication and cross-team collaboration. Newbold et al.~\cite{Newbold2022NewNormals} proposed a framework for organisational responses to remote work, emphasising socio-technical adjustments.

Münch et al.~\cite{munch2022capabilities} highlighted the role of digital infrastructure in enabling remote service delivery. Leonardi et al.~\cite{Leonardi2024RemoteWork} analysed how remote work reshapes organisational structures and employee autonomy, while Raj et al.~\cite{Raj2023Remote} reported positive correlations between remote work and firm performance, supported by digital infrastructure and managerial readiness.

Keppler and Leonardi~\cite{Keppler2023RelationalConfidence} explored how digital tools foster relational confidence in remote environments. Smite et al.~\cite{Smite2023WFHFlexibility} emphasised the need for flexible post-pandemic work policies, and Fan and Moen~\cite{Fan2023SubjectiveWellbeing} linked remote work with higher well-being levels. Lauring and Jonasson~\cite{Lauring2024Hybrid} critically reviewed hybrid work models, addressing terminology and cultural impacts. Choudhury et al.~\cite{Choudhury2024Hybrid} found that hybrid work supports productivity and employee satisfaction.

While these studies offer valuable insights into remote and hybrid work, most focus on Western contexts and organisational-level analysis. They often overlook socio-cultural conditions in emerging economies and employee-level perceptions. This study addresses these gaps by adopting an inductive qualitative approach to explore employees’ views on remote and office-based work in Indonesia. It contributes to the literature by providing context-specific evidence from an underrepresented workforce and proposing an IT framework grounded in employee-driven insights, offering practical guidance for remote work implementation in developing countries.



\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Data for this research were collected through an online survey\footnote{The questionnaire is available at \url{https://forms.gle/phfgBDmFPEVUU95R8}
} conducted between February and May 2023 via Google Forms. The questionnaire aimed to capture employees' perceptions of remote and office-based work in Indonesia, focusing on advantages, disadvantages, ethical considerations, and technology use. Participants were informed that their data would be used solely for research and could withdraw at any time.

The survey was distributed across various industries using social media platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram), messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal), and direct group chats. Respondents were based in Indonesian cities, including Jakarta, Tangerang, Depok, Bogor, and Bekasi. The responses were compiled into a CSV file, containing data primarily in Indonesian, with partial English translations. The dataset was created to reflect employees' views on remote and office-based work.

A qualitative approach was used to analyse the data, applying inductive thematic analysis \cite{hamilton2019qualitative,kumar2018qualitative}. Responses were categorised into thematic groups and arranged by frequency \cite{seixas2018qualitative,turale2020brief}, providing insights into employee perspectives. The questionnaire also collected demographic and job-related information, including gender, age, industry, job role, responsibilities, and work arrangement preferences. Open-ended questions explored perceived benefits and drawbacks of working from home (WFH), office (WFO), and anywhere (WFA), as well as technologies used and ethical considerations. Detailed descriptions of these variables are provided in Table~\ref{Data Explanation}.

\subsection{Expected Ethics and Norms for Remote Work}
\label{sec:ethics-remote-work}

The questionnaire included an open-ended question to identify ethics, norms, and behaviours considered essential for remote work. Responses were categorised into four ethical themes, as summarised in Table~\ref{tab:ethics_for_remote_work}. The most frequently mentioned theme is \textit{Work Ethics and Responsibilities} (137 mentions), covering responsibility, discipline, and integrity, with the most cited subgroup being \textit{Timely Contact by Superiors, Managers, and Colleagues} (43 mentions). Other subgroups include responsibility towards work, dress code, independence, orderliness, honesty, ethical trust, and accountability. The second theme is \textit{Communication and Collaboration} (63 mentions), with key subgroups such as the expectation to \textit{Turn on the Camera during Video Calls} (21 mentions) and \textit{Clear and Effective Communication} (20 mentions), along with polite communication, email etiquette, and regular meetings. The third theme, \textit{Efficiency and Productivity} (22 mentions), includes adherence to \textit{Standard Operating Procedures} (12 mentions), meeting efficiency, procedure revision, continuous learning, and screen monitoring. The fourth theme is \textit{Performance Measurement} (20 mentions), mainly related to \textit{Objective-Based Performance Measurement} (19 mentions). These findings suggest that employees expect clear ethical guidelines covering responsibility, communication, productivity, and fair performance evaluation in remote work settings.

%	\label{fig:it-framework}
%\end{figure*}

Based on the findings in Section~\ref{sec:results}, key components for an IT framework to support remote work can be identified. These components are derived from respondents’ perceptions of remote work advantages, disadvantages, ethical considerations, technology use, and feasibility factors, as summarised in Tables~\ref{Advantage of WFH}, \ref{Disadvantages of WFH}, \ref{Advantage of WFO}, \ref{Disadvantages of WFO}, \ref{Advantages of WFA}, \ref{Disadvantages of WFA}, \ref{Used Application for Remote Work}, \ref{tab:required_apps_for_remote_work}, and \ref{tab:ethics_for_remote_work}.

\textbf{Governance and Policy.}
Clear ethical guidelines and measurable performance indicators are necessary (Table~\ref{tab:ethics_for_remote_work}). The framework should include: (1) \textit{Remote Work Guidelines} on conduct, communication, and working hours; (2) \textit{Performance Measurement} through objective evaluation; and (3) \textit{Attendance and Reporting Procedures}.

\textbf{Digital Skills and Awareness.}
Findings indicate challenges in communication, discipline, and technology use (Tables~\ref{Disadvantages of WFH}, \ref{Disadvantages of WFA}). The framework should cover: (1) \textit{Capacity Building} through training; and (2) \textit{Remote Work Mindset Development} programmes.

\textbf{Employee Well-being and Work-Life Balance.}
Maintaining well-being and balance is a key concern (Tables~\ref{Disadvantages of WFH}, \ref{Disadvantages of WFO}). The framework should include: (1) \textit{Well-being Monitoring} channels; and (2) \textit{Work-Life Balance Policies} encouraging flexibility and limiting working hours.

\textbf{Application Ecosystem.}
Respondents reported using various digital applications to support remote work (Table~\ref{Used Application for Remote Work}). The framework should provide an integrated ecosystem, including: (1) \textit{Communication and Collaboration Tools} like Zoom and Microsoft Teams; (2) \textit{Productivity Applications} for task and project management; (3) \textit{Document and Workspace Systems} such as Office 365 and Google Workspace; and (4) \textit{Advanced Technologies}, including AI-based tools (Table~\ref{tab:required_apps_for_remote_work}).

\textbf{Infrastructure Readiness.}
Reliable internet access and adequate hardware are essential for remote work. Respondents highlighted the need for \textit{stable, high-speed internet} and \textit{company-provided devices} (Table~\ref{tab:required_apps_for_remote_work}). The framework should include: (1) \textit{Reliable Internet Access}; (2) \textit{Device Provision} with standardised hardware; and (3) \textit{Security Infrastructure}, such as VPN, single sign-on (SSO), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

\textbf{Support and Troubleshooting Mechanism.}
Technical issues were highlighted by respondents (Tables~\ref{Disadvantages of WFH}, \ref{Disadvantages of WFA}). The framework should offer: (1) \textit{IT Helpdesk and Remote Assistance}; and (2) \textit{Technical Support Procedures}.


These components provide a comprehensive IT framework addressing the technical, ethical, and organisational aspects of remote work, aligned with the needs identified in the analysis.

\section{Sequential Framework for Remote Work Implementation}

This section discusses the proposed sequential framework to implement effective and sustainable remote work practices, based on the six key components identified from the study. The framework adopts a top-down approach inspired by TOGAF \cite{TheOpenGroup2018}, enterprise architecture best practices \cite{Ross2006}, and IT strategy frameworks \cite{Henderson1993}, ensuring that organisational policies, people readiness, technology, and operational support are addressed systematically.

\textbf{1. Governance and Policy.}  
Governance and Policy serve as the foundation of the framework. It establishes the organisational rules, guidelines, financial considerations, and evaluation mechanisms required to manage remote work effectively. This includes defining Remote Work Guidelines on employee conduct, communication standards, and working hours; Performance Measurement systems to ensure accountability and productivity; Attendance and Reporting Procedures for operational monitoring; and policies to maintain Employee Well-being and Work-Life Balance. Governance and Policy also encompass aligning remote work initiatives with broader business goals and strategies to ensure that remote work supports organisational competitiveness, service delivery, and innovation objectives. Financial aspects such as budgeting for remote work infrastructure, licensing costs for digital applications, employee reimbursements for connectivity or devices, and long-term cost-benefit analyses should be addressed within this component. As the strategic anchor, Governance and Policy must be addressed first before rolling out other operational components to ensure clarity, compliance, alignment with strategic goals, and financial feasibility.

\textbf{2. Digital Skills and Awareness.}  
Once governance structures are established, organisations need to prepare their workforce. Digital Skills and Awareness cover Capacity Building through targeted training programmes to equip employees with essential technical skills, and Remote Work Mindset Development initiatives to foster adaptability, autonomy, and responsible remote work ethics. This component can be developed in parallel with Application Ecosystem planning, ensuring that employees are ready to utilise the tools effectively upon deployment.

\textbf{3. Application Ecosystem.}  
The Application Ecosystem involves providing an integrated suite of digital tools necessary for remote work operations. This includes Communication and Collaboration Tools such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams; Productivity Applications for task and project management; Document and Workspace Systems like Office 365 and Google Workspace; and Advanced Technologies including AI-based tools to enhance efficiency. While deployment depends on infrastructure readiness, planning and configuration can proceed in parallel with Digital Skills development.

\textbf{4. Infrastructure Readiness.}  
A reliable technological foundation is essential for any remote work strategy. Infrastructure Readiness includes ensuring Reliable Internet Access for all staff; Device Provision with standardised and secure hardware; and implementation of Security Infrastructure such as VPNs, Single Sign-On (SSO), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect organisational assets. Device provisioning and network upgrades can commence in parallel with Skills and Application preparation, but Security Infrastructure setup must align with Governance policies defined earlier.

\textbf{5. Support and Troubleshooting Mechanism.}  
To maintain operational continuity, Support and Troubleshooting Mechanisms must be established. This involves setting up an IT Helpdesk for day-to-day assistance, Remote Assistance services for distributed teams, and Technical Support Procedures for efficient issue resolution. This component should be operational before or alongside the final deployment of applications and infrastructure to ensure immediate support during rollout.

\textbf{6. Employee Well-being and Work-Life Balance.}  
Employee Well-being and Work-Life Balance are addressed as a continuous and integrated pillar of the framework. Organisations should implement Well-being Monitoring channels to track employee health and morale, and enforce Work-Life Balance Policies that encourage flexibility while preventing overwork. Although it is discussed last in the sequence, well-being initiatives should be embedded across all stages to ensure sustainable remote work adoption.




\section{Threats to Validity and Limitations}

This study faces several validity threats and limitations. The data were collected through an online questionnaire using convenience sampling, which may introduce sampling bias and limit the representativeness of the respondents, who were primarily recruited via social media and messaging platforms in selected Indonesian cities. The reliance on self-reported perceptions may also be influenced by subjective interpretations and social desirability bias. Additionally, the qualitative analysis focused on frequently mentioned themes, potentially overlooking nuanced insights or minority views. The data collection period in early 2023 may not capture subsequent developments in remote work practices. Furthermore, the findings and proposed IT framework are specific from the Indonesian context and may require adaptation if implemented in other settings. Future studies should consider more diverse samples and longitudinal approaches to capture evolving remote work experiences.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This study analysed employees' perceptions of remote and office-based work in Indonesia, identifying key advantages, disadvantages, and expectations regarding technology use and ethical norms. The findings informed the development of an IT framework to support remote work implementation, covering infrastructure, application ecosystem, governance, digital skills, well-being, technical support, and risk management. Future research should involve a larger, more diverse sample to improve generalisability and consider quantitative or mixed-method approaches to enrich the findings. Further studies may also evaluate the framework's effectiveness in organisational contexts and examine the long-term impact of remote work on employee performance and well-being.
